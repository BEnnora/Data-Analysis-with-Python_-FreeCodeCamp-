    "Key features include:\n",
    "- Counting race distribution\n",
    "- Calculating average age of men\n",
    "- Determining the percentage of individuals with Bachelor's degrees\n",
    "- Comparing income levels of people with and without higher education\n",
    "- Identifying minimum work hours and who earns >50K within that group\n",
    "- Finding the country with the highest percentage of high earners\n",
    "- Discovering the most common occupation for high earners in India\n",
