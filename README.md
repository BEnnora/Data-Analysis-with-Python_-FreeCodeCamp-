## üìÇ Projects

### ‚úÖ 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
[View notebook](./mean_var_std_calculator/mean-variance-standard%20deviation%20calculator.ipynb)  
Computes statistical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum) for rows, columns, and the entire 3√ó3 matrix using NumPy.

### ‚úÖ 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
[View notebook](./demographic_data_analyzer/demographic-data-analyzer.ipynb)  
Analyzes demographic data to compute summary statistics and identify patterns across different groups, such as average age, education levels, and income brackets.

### ‚úÖ 3. Medical Data Visualizer  
[View notebook](./medical_data_visualizer/medical-data-visualizer.ipynb)  
Processes clinical examination data to compute and visualize health indicators. Includes BMI-based overweight classification, binary normalization of cholesterol and glucose levels, and visual summaries using categorical plots and correlation heatmaps.

### ‚úÖ 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer  
[View notebook](./page_view_time_series_visualizer/page-view-time-series-visualizer.ipynb)  
Analyzes freeCodeCamp forum page view data between May 2016 and December 2019. Cleans the dataset by removing statistical outliers, then visualizes long-term and seasonal trends using a line chart, a grouped bar chart, and dual box plots showing yearly and monthly distributions.

### ‚úÖ 5. Sea Level Predictor  
[View notebook](./sea_level_predictor/sea-level-predictor.ipynb)  
Analyzes global sea level data from 1880 to 2013 and predicts future trends through linear regression. Includes two lines of best fit: one based on all available historical data, and one starting from the year 2000 to capture more recent changes. Visualizes both projections up to the year 2050 using `matplotlib` and `scipy`.
